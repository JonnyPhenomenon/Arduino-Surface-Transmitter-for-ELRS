**Arduino Surface Radio Project - for ExpressLRS 2.4ghz**

<i>(Surface radios are used for remote control cars, tanks, and boats.  In other words, things that do not fly)</i>

Initially we will be working toward making an arduino send commands/inputs from a steering wheel and buttons over uart via crsf protocol to an off-the-shelf ExpressLRS module.

<i>After that, who knows. :)</i>

Inspired by kkbin505â€™s Arduino Transmitter for ELRS project https://github.com/kkbin505/Arduino-Transmitter-for-ELRS
We will be expanding on some of the work already done by kkbin505, cruwallero, JamesK, r-u-t-r-A, Pawel, the ExpressLRS devs, and probably a lot of others. 

**All information about this project will be found in the wiki.
